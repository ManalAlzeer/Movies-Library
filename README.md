# Movies library


For this project we used a movies dataset to classify a group of movies with four categories.
Each type of known movie is represented by different colored bubbles.

**Genres are:** Action, Animation, Horror, Drama.
The genre of action is represented by the blue bubble, the yellow bubble animation, the horror with the red bubble, and the drama with the purple bubble. 

And used **JavaScript** to simulate bubbles.
When the curser moves over a bubble a brief information of the movie appear which are movie genre, name and rating. Additionally, if the user clicks on a specific bubble, The bubble becomes larger and contains the description of the movie.
