		This visualization represents four types of the known movie genres in different colourful bubbles.<br>
		The genres are as follow: action, animation, horror and drama.<br>
		Action genre is represented by blue bubble, Animation genre is represented by yellow bubble, Horror genre is represented by red genre bubble, Drama genre is represented by purple bubble. <br>
		<br>
		If the curser moves over a bubble a brief information of the movie appear which are movie genre, name and rating.<br>
		If the rating was high, the bubble appears larger and vice versa.in addition, if the user clicks on specific bubble,the bubble comes larger containing the movie description.<br>
